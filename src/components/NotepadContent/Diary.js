            make a band.  a band is a unit. a band is a farce. a force. a single entity of multiple entities. once one has a band, A band, keep a band. a band has shame. a band has power. more power than any one. a band must not have one leader. a band must fight. a band must agree. no, disagree. a band will suck; hard. a band is nothing, really. a band is real (but not really). a band fakes. a band makes, songs. a band sucks. a band is directionless, but the next step is obviously contiguous. if a band is lost, now, the past is impervious. a band hides. a band chills. a band sweats. a band bleeds, when cut. a band seeks. a band feels; good. a band lies. when a band gets loud, one listens. if a band get soft, one may not. a band drowns, in fear! a band is free
